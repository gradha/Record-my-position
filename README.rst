General
=======

Record my GPS position is a simple iPhone client to record and save GPS
information. The stored positions in the database can later be extracted
through iTunes file interface or emailed in CSV/GPX format to process for
different purposes with external programs.

The CSV dumps contains all the possible device information while the GPX
version is just for convenience allowing you to view positions in another
program, since most information is stripped.  The ``csv_to_kml/csv_to_kml.py``
script can convert the CSV file to a prettier KML/GPX file for opening in
`Google Earth`__.

Note that for the moment the program only uses active GPS, which
drains the battery quickly, even when running in the background.
Don't run it for more than an hour if you want to use your iPhone
as something other than a dead weight.

The app works for the iPod touch, but the accuracy varies a lot
and you depend on wifi location, so you won't get very useful
readings in open fields, only in crowded cities which may have been
previously mapped by Skyhook (http://www.skyhookwireless.com/), the
people doing wifi core location for Apple. On the plus side I had
my iPod touch on with the program running in the background for a
whole day and didn't consume more than a quarter of the battery,
so it seems the wifi location doesn't require as much power.

This program was possible due to `eFaber`__ being nice guys and
allowing me to release this as open source. You can browse more
software made by eFaber at http://itunes.com/apps/svetoslavivantchev/.

Source code
===========

Requirements
------------

The source code compiles against SDK 8.0, which is the current lowest supported
SDK by Apple. Previous to the 8.0 update the code supported deployment on 3.x
OS versions, but that's not Apple's cup of tea, you are presumed to upgrade
your hardware every year, so you likely won't make use of that anyway.

In order to dynamically generate the versioned splash number, you need Cobra
(http://cobra-language.com/) to compile the ``script/watermark.cobra`` program
and run it.


Installation
------------

Here are the steps to compile and build yourself everything:

* Perform some terminal magic::

    git clone git://github.com/svet/Record-my-position.git
    cd Record-my-position
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

* If you want to generate the versioned splash images::

    cobra scripts/watermark.cobra -run-args vX.Y.Z

  If you don't want to bother with cobra, simply copy the
  ``Default*.png`` images from ``resources/reference`` to ``resources``
  so that XCode can find something.
* Open Record_my_position.xcodeproj with XCode and build and run.
* Turn on the GPS tracking and record some positions.
* In the **Share** tab use the button that sends you the logs.
* Process the CSV logs with ``csv_to_kml/csv_to_kml.py``, a Python
  script. It generates KML or GPX files.
* Open the converted KML/GPX files with `Google Earth`__.
